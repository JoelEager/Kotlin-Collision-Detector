# Kotlin Collision Detector
Performs collision detection on convex 2D polygons by means of the separating axis theorem.

This is a Kotlin port of the collision detection logic used by pyTanks 
[here](https://github.com/JoelEager/pyTanks.Server/blob/master/gameLogic/collisionDetector.py). Both this 
implementation and the Python implementation located there are configured to test the execution time of this algorithm.

This algorithm has also been ported to Rust [here](https://github.com/JoelEager/Rust-Collision-Detector).
